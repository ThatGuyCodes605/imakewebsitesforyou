    I create custom websites that are fast, modern, and user-friendly. From simple personal pages to interactive projects,
    I design and build everything using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focus on clean design, smooth performance, and
    making each site work perfectly on any device. Whether you need a portfolio, a blog, or a fun, creative project,
    I can bring your ideas to life on the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every website I make is fully responsive, meaning it looks amazing on phones, tablets, and desktops alike. I pay
    attention to details like typography, colors, and layout to create an experience that visitors enjoy and remember.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also provide ongoing support and updates, ensuring your website remains fresh and secure. From adding new pages to improving
    performance, I’m here to make sure your online presence grows with your needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    My projects aren’t just about looks—they’re about functionality too. I implement features like contact forms, image
    galleries, sliders, and interactive elements that engage your audience and make your website more than just a static page.
  </p>

  <p>
    I take pride in working closely with clients. Before starting any project, I listen carefully to your ideas and goals,
    helping you shape a website that truly represents your vision. Together, we can brainstorm layouts, color schemes, and
    unique features that make your site stand out.
