    I create custom websites that are fast, modern, and user-friendly. From simple personal pages to interactive projects,
    I design and build everything using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focus on clean design, smooth performance, and
    making each site work perfectly on any device. Whether you need a portfolio, a blog, or a fun, creative project,
    I can bring your ideas to life on the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every website I make is fully responsive, meaning it looks amazing on phones, tablets, and desktops alike. I pay
    attention to details like typography, colors, and layout to create an experience that visitors enjoy and remember.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also provide ongoing support and updates, ensuring your website remains fresh and secure. From adding new pages to improving
    performance, I‚Äôm here to make sure your online presence grows with your needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    My projects aren‚Äôt just about looks‚Äîthey‚Äôre about functionality too. I implement features like contact forms, image
    galleries, sliders, and interactive elements that engage your audience and make your website more than just a static page.
  </p>

  <p>
    I take pride in working closely with clients. Before starting any project, I listen carefully to your ideas and goals,
    helping you shape a website that truly represents your vision. Together, we can brainstorm layouts, color schemes, and
    unique features that make your site stand out.
  </p>

  <p>
    Security and performance are also top priorities. I optimize websites for fast loading times and ensure they follow
    best practices for online safety. Your visitors will enjoy a smooth, reliable experience, and you‚Äôll have peace of mind
    knowing your site is built responsibly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you are an individual, a small business, or a creative project, I can provide the right solution for you.
    From simple landing pages to complex interactive sites, I adapt my approach to meet your needs while keeping the process
    straightforward.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to building new websites, I can help revamp or upgrade existing ones. If your current site feels outdated,
    slow, or hard to use, I can give it a fresh look, improve performance, and add modern functionality. This ensures your
    website continues to impress visitors and supports your goals.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love experimenting with creative effects, animations, and custom designs. From dynamic sliders to subtle hover effects,
    I use small touches to make your website feel polished, professional, and engaging. These details may seem minor, but
    they leave a lasting impression on your visitors.
